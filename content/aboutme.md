### About Me

I'm a gen-z interested in computer industry, specifically on sotware-level digital technology. I want to keep learning and improve my skills. I like to figure things out and do engineering.

As a Gen Z professional passionate about the computer industry, I'm particularly drawn to software-level digital technology. I thrive on continuous learning and skill development. My curiosity drives me to dive deep into how systems work, and I find genuine satisfaction in building solutions.

### My Thoughts

I always have many thoughts thinking in my head. Sometimes it sounds unrealistic, sometimes miracle happens. I tend to curious about everything. Once I get interested or seen it's potential of linking to other knowledge, I will put more effort to understand it. I often wonder things into a more complex level. Sometimes I got myself complicated, wrong, biased, off-topic, sometimes I just got the key and unlocked my understanding in a higher level of abstraction. That's when I found thing makes sense and are satisfied. I like to learn and stimulate my mind.

This mind is unique, not everyone understands it, sometimes I also don't understand either. In MBTI, they call it high-N.

Most arguable things have two sides. Either side have it's own pro, cons, tradeoffs. Different indivigual assigns the meaning of right and wrong. A balance of these two side, or a solution suitable to the current criteria will be good.

Above, is my philosophy of thinking. Because of this, I often face thoughts challenges with the environment, but I certainly will found a solution to figure it out.
